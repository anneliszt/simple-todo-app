# A Simple To-do List App

This repository hosts all the necessary files and code for my Todo List App developed with the Flutter framework. The app's primary focus is to demonstrate how to create a basic yet functional task management application. The use of Hive, a lightweight and fast local database, ensures efficient data storage and retrieval.
